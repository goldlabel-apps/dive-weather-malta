## Baseline PWA

Once we've got a good baseline repo we should make that a public template. What we want is a React app which can be cloned, installed and run with minimal fuss. From that point is should be 100% obvious where to code in the framework so that it can be easily made into a module and consumed by other react apps

Create React App will be our friend. Let's say we set a precedent which says: If an app is created in this way, it'll work

1. Create a brand new app with this command [tutorial](https://react-redux.js.org/tutorials/typescript-quick-start)

```bash
# Redux + TypeScript template
npx create-react-app pwa --template redux-typescript
```
